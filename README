This is the README file for the Reverse Pi Camera backup camera replacement with depth sensing.

This project is currently in production.

The camera runs off a Raspberry Pi utilizing the rPi Camera V2 from Adafruit. The software is built on pygame to grab images off the camera and send them to the frame buffer.
